My personal choice is definitely Google Flights since Google always has the best and most organized data on the web. Therefore, I searched for APIs on Google.</p> <p>\ud83d\udd0e Search  google flights api</p> <p>The results? Bad. It seems like they discontinued this service and it now lives in the Graveyard of Google.</p> <p><sup>\ud83e\uddcf\u200d\u2642\ufe0f duffel.com</sup> <sup>Google Flights API: How did it work &amp; what happened to it? <p>The Google Flights API offered developers access to aggregated airline data, including flight times, availability, and prices. Over a decade ago, Google announced the acquisition of ITA Software Inc. which it used to develop its API. However, in 2018, Google ended access to the public-facing API and now only offers access through the QPX enterprise product.</p> <p>That's awful! I've also looked for free alternatives but their rate limits and pricing are just \ud83d\ude2c (not a good fit/deal for everyone).</p> <p></p> <p>However, Google Flights has their UI \u2013 flights.google.com. So, maybe I could just use Developer Tools to log the requests made and just replicate all of that? Undoubtedly not! Their requests are just full of numbers and unreadable text, so that's not the solution.</p> <p>Perhaps, we could scrape it? I mean, Google allowed many companies like Serpapi to scrape their web just pretending like nothing happened... So let's scrape our own.</p> <p>\ud83d\udd0e Search  google flights api scraper pypi</p> <p>Excluding the ones that are not active, I came across hugoglvs/google-flights-scraper on Pypi. I thought to myself: \"aint no way this is the solution!\"</p> <p>I checked hugoglvs's code on GitHub, and I immediately detected \"playwright,\" my worst enemy. One word can describe it well: slow. Two words? Extremely slow. What's more, it doesn't even run on the \ud83d\uddfb Edge because of configuration errors, missing libraries... etc. I could just reverse try.playwright.tech and use a better environment, but that's just too risky if they added Cloudflare as an additional security barrier \ud83d\ude33.</p> <p>Life tells me to never give up. Let's just take a look at their URL params...</p> <pre><code>https://www.google.com/travel/flights/search?tfs=CBwQAhoeEgoyMDI0LTA1LTI4agcIARIDVFBFcgcIARIDTVlKGh4SCjIwMjQtMDUtMzBqBwgBEgNNWUpyBwgBEgNUUEVAAUgBcAGCAQsI____________AZgBAQ&amp;hl=en\n</code></pre> Param Content My past understanding hl en Sets the language. tfs CBwQAhoeEgoyMDI0LTA1LTI4agcIARID\u2026 What is this???? \ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e <p>I removed the <code>?tfs=</code> parameter and found out that this is the control of our request! And it looks so base64-y.</p> <p>If we decode it to raw text, we can still see the dates, but we're not quite there \u2014 there's too much unwanted Unicode text.</p> <p>Or maybe it's some kind of a data-storing method Google uses? What if it's something like JSON? Let's look it up.</p> <p>\ud83d\udd0e Search  google's json alternative</p> <p>\ud83d\udc23 Result Solution: The Power of Protocol Buffers</p> <p>LinkedIn turned to Protocol Buffers, often referred to as protobuf, a binary serialization format developed by Google. The key advantage of Protocol Buffers is its efficiency, compactness, and speed, making it significantly faster than JSON for serialization and deserialization.</p> <p>Gotcha, Protobuf! Let's feed it to an online decoder and see how it does:</p> <p>\ud83d\udd0e Search  protobuf decoder</p> <p>\ud83d\udc23 Result protobuf-decoder.netlify.app</p> <p>I then pasted the Base64-encoded string to the decoder and no way! It DID return valid data!</p> <p></p> <p>I immediately recognized the values \u2014 that's my data, that's my query!</p> <p>So, I wrote some simple Protobuf code to decode the data.</p> <pre><code>syntax = \"proto3\"\n\nmessage Airport {\n    string name = 2;\n}\n\nmessage FlightInfo {\n    string date = 2;\n    Airport dep_airport = 13;\n    Airport arr_airport = 14;\n}\n\nmessage GoogleSucks {\n    repeated FlightInfo = 3;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>It works!

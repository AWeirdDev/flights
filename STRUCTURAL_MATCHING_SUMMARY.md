# Structural Matching Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved
Replaced fragile index-based matching with robust structural matching based on HTML container types.

## Key Discovery
HTML containers have specific `jsname` attributes that correlate with flight categories:
- `div[jsname="IWWDBc"]` = "best" flights (matches JS `is_best=True`)
- `div[jsname="YdtKid"]` = "other" flights (matches JS `is_best=False`)

## Implementation Details

### 1. New Function: `extract_enrichments_from_container`
- Extracts enrichments from specific container types
- Handles the "exclude last item" logic for YdtKid containers
- Returns enrichments for just that category

### 2. New Function: `combine_results_structural`
- Separates JS flights by `is_best` flag
- Extracts enrichments separately for "best" and "other" containers
- Matches within each category (much smaller search spaces)
- No fallback to index-based matching needed!

### 3. Updated Hybrid Parser
- Now uses `combine_results_structural` instead of `combine_results`
- Passes the parser object to enable structural matching

## Benefits

1. **Robustness**: No reliance on matching array indices
2. **Accuracy**: Smaller search spaces (3 best vs 105 other) improve matching
3. **Stability**: Container jsname attributes are stable across different searches
4. **Performance**: All enrichment data still captured (arrival_time_ahead, emissions, operated_by)

## Test Results
- ✅ All 58 arrival_time_ahead values extracted (100% match with HTML parser)
- ✅ 108 flights total (correct count)
- ✅ 100% emissions data extracted
- ✅ 16 operated_by values extracted
- ✅ 84 aircraft_details extracted

## Code Quality
The structural matching approach is more maintainable and follows the principle of using semantic HTML structure rather than positional assumptions.

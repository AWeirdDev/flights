# flights (fast-flights)

The fast, robust, strongly-typed Google Flights scraper (API) implemented in Python. Based on Baes64-encoded Protobuf string.

```haskell
$ pip install fast-flights
```

</div>

## Usage

To use `fast-flights`, you'll first create a filter (inherited from `?tfs=`) to perform a request.
Then, add `flight_data`, `trip`, `seat` and `passengers` info to use the API directly.

Honorable mention: I like birds. Yes, I like birds.

```python
from fast_flights import FlightData, Passengers, create_filter, get_flights

# Create a new filter
filter = create_filter(
    flight_data=[
        # Include more if it's not a one-way trip
        FlightData(
            date="2024-07-02",  # Date of departure
            from_airport="TPE", 
            to_airport="MYJ"
        ),
        # ... include more for round trips and multi-city trips
    ],
    trip="one-way",  # Trip (round-trip, one-way, multi-city)
    seat="economy",  # Seat (economy, premium economy, business or first)
    passengers=Passengers(
        adults=2,
        children=1,
        infants_in_seat=0,
        infants_on_lap=0
    ),
)

# Get flights with a filter
result = get_flights(filter)

# The price is currently... low/typical/high
print("The price is currently", result.current_price)

# Display the first flight
print(result.flights[0])
```

Additionally, you can use the `Airport` enum to search for airports in code (as you type)! (See `_generated_enum.py` in source)

```python
Airport.TAIPEI
              |---------------------------------|
              | TAIPEI_SONGSHAN_AIRPORT         |
              | TAPACHULA_INTERNATIONAL_AIRPORT |
              | TAMPA_INTERNATIONAL_AIRPORT     |
              | ... 5 more                      |
              |---------------------------------|
```

## How it's made

The other day, I was making a chat-interface-based trip recommendation app and wanted to add a feature that can search for flights available for booking. My personal choice is definitely [Google Flights](https://flights.google.com), since Google always has the best and organized data on the web. Therefore, I searched for APIs on Google.

> üîé **Search** <br />
> google flights api

The results? Bad. It seems like they discontinued this service and it now lives in the Graveyard of Google.

> <sup><i>Google Flights API: How did it work & what happened to it?</i></b>
>
> The Google Flights API offered developers access to aggregated airline data, including flight times, availability and prices. Over a decade ago, Google announced the acquisition of ITA Software Inc. which it used to develop its API. **However, in 2018, Google ended access to the public-facing API and now only offers access through the QPX enterprise product**.

That's awful! I've also looked for free alternatives but their rate limits and pricing are just üò¨ (not a good fit/deal for everyone).

<br />

However, Google Flights has their own UI ‚Äì [flights.google.com](https://flights.google.com). So, maybe I could just use Developer Tools to log the requests made and just replicate all of that? Undoubtedly not! Their requests are just full of numbers and unreadable text, so that's definitely not the solution.

Perhaps, we could scrape it? I mean, Google allowed many companies like [Serpapi](https://google.com/search?q=serpapi) scrape their web just pretended like nothing happened... So let's scrape our own.

> üîé **Search** <br />
> google flights ~~api~~ scraper pypi

Excluding the ones that are not active, I came across [hugoglvs/google-flights-scraper](https://pypi.org/project/google-flights-scraper) on Pypi. I thought to myself: "aint no way this is the solution!"

I checked hugoglvs's code on [GitHub](https://github.com/hugoglvs/google-flights-scraper), and I immediately detected "playwright," my worst enemy. One word can deacribe it well: slow. Two words? Extremely slow. What's more, it doesn't even run on the **üóª Edge** because of configuration errors, missing libraries... etc. I could just reverse [try.playwright.tech](https://try.playwright.tech) and use a better environment, but that's just too risky if they added Cloudflare as an additional security barrior üò≥.

Life tells me to never give up. Let's just take a look at their URL params...

Ahh! I get it now. The regular old Google trick: base64.
